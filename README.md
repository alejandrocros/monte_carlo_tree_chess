# Monte Carlo Tree Search Methods for Chess

In this repo I will share the code for some implementations of Monte Carlo Tree Seach algorithms for playing chess as part of a Masters course in Monte-Carlo search and games.


Useful notebooks will be stored in the `/notebooks` folder.


## TO-DO

- Implement `random_move` as a ChessBoard method.
- Documentation.
