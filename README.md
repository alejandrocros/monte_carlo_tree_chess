# Monte Carlo Tree Search Methods for Chess

In this repo I will share the code for some implementations of Monte Carlo Tree Seach algorithms for playing chess as part of a Masters course in Monte-Carlo search and games.


Useful notebooks will be stored in the `/notebooks` folder:
- The notebook `MCTS_Code.ipynb` stores some useful code to implement the algorithms (the main part of it already migrated to the `src` folder).

- The notebook `UTC_comparison.ipynb` generates the graphics for the UTC experiments.


## TO-DO

Some interesting things to do in order to upgrade this repo and make more readable could be:


- [ ] Investigate the recursion problems found in RAVE.

- [ ] Create a `Player` class with all the strategies implemented.

- [ ] Implement `random_move` as a ChessBoard method.

- [X] Documentation.
