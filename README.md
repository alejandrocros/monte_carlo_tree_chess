# Monte Carlo Tree Search Methods for Chess

In this repo I will share the code for some implementations of Monte Carlo Tree Seach algorithms for playing chess as part of a Masters course in Monte-Carlo search and games.


Useful notebooks will be stored in the `/notebooks` folder.


## TO-DO

[ ] Create a `Player` class with all the strategies implemented.

[ ] Implement `random_move` as a ChessBoard method.
